1. Summarize your understanding of `node_modules` and it's relationship with `package.json` (covered in the video for the lesson).
From my understanding of the video 'node_modules' (I'm not sure if this is right so please correct me if I'm wrong) is the initial code that we will be working with and 'package.json' acts as a filter?

2. What does the ${} syntax do inside backticks? Why is it useful?
From my understanding the $() syntax inside the backticks made it to where you can place information in a string without it being edited. It is useful in my opinion because it gets rid of the possibility for an error to occur. For example, if you were to do - "5" + "2", you would get "52". But if you were to have a const named "x" and "y" with the same numbers as before you could do - ${x} + ${y} and get "7".


3. What happened when you saved your code in VS Code? (Did it auto-format? Did you see any errors?)
When I saved my code in VS I noticed that Vs would auto-format the code. VS also kept making it very known to me when I did make a mistake.

4. How many commits did you make for this assignment? Why is it better to make multiple small commits instead of one large commit?
I made 4 commits on accident because I thought that there was an error on my end. I ended up adding the same commits without realizing it. I believe that it is better for us to make multiple small commits instead of one large commit, because it will be easier for us to track down any mistakes we've made in the past.

5. When do we use `const` vs `let`? What about `var`?
We use `const` when we want to make a variable not reassigned and we use a `let` when we know that we will change the value of that variable later. I don't think we use `var` because judging by your response in the video, `var` is old.
